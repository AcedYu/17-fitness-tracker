# 17-fitness-tracker
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 17 for the program. In this assignment I added backend functionality onto some starter code to create a functional fitness tracker application. I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema with Express handle routes.

It contains notable features such as:
- the ability to view, create, and track workout routines
- several trackable workout attributes
  - name
  - type
  - weight
  - sets
  - reps
  - duration
  - distance (for cardio exercises only)
- A viewable stats page that encompasses the data from multiple exercises
